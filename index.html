title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
author: "Harper Lee",
link: "https://www.amazon.com/Kill-Mockingbird-Harper-Lee/dp/0446310786",
blurb: "A powerful story of racial injustice and the loss of innocence in a small Southern town.",
firstPage: "When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt."
},
{
title: "Pride and Prejudice",
author: "Jane Austen",
link: "https://www.amazon.com/Pride-Prejudice-Jane-Austen/dp/0486284735",
blurb: "A witty and romantic novel of manners that explores the social conventions of Regency England.",
firstPage: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."
},
{
title: "1984",
author: "George Orwell",
link: "https://www.amazon.com/1984-Signet-Classics-George-Orwell/dp/0451524934",
blurb: "A dystopian novel set in a totalitarian society where individualism is crushed and Big Brother is always watching.",
firstPage: "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him."
},
{
title: "Moby-Dick",
author: "Herman Melville",
link: "https://www.amazon.com/Moby-Dick-Herman-Melville/dp/0143124676",
blurb: "A tale of obsession and revenge as a sailor named Ishmael joins the crew of the Pequod on a hunt for the white whale, Moby Dick.",
firstPage: "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me."
